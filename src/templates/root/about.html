  <h2>What is #vss365?</h2>
  <p><strong>#vss365</strong> is a tweet-sized writing game based on a specific daily word prompt.
    Entries must incorporate the word into a story or poem. The words are typically used as
    thematic inspiration but can be used however the writer wishes. The prompt is delievered by
    the designated host on their Twitter account. There are two new hosts every month, each with
    their own unique style and word choices.</p>

  <p>#vss365 was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://makingfiction.com/history-of-vss365/">created</a>
    by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190330072444/https://theflashdogs.com/a-daily-dose-of-short-fiction/">FlashDogs</a>
    in 2016 and originally planned to last one year. After growing in popularity, Voimaoy began
    the process of scheduling monthly hosts. She maintained this role until 2020,
    when Arthur Unk took over scheduling.</p>

  <p>"vss365" stands for Very Short Story 365. The idea behind the hashtag is to give writers
    daily writing inspiration every day of the year. Because the stories were the size of tweets,
    they were dubbed "very short" stories.</p>
